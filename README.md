# sucuri
an assignment I was given at a job interview

Requirements:
 - Firefox
 - JDK
 - Eclipse
 - JUnit
 
 
Setup:
1. Either download the source from my GitHub or directly from the archive location I've send
2. Extract (if needed)
3. Open Eclipse and Import both the projects 
4. Create a user lib containing all files from [extracted_archive]/lib
5. Configure buildpath of each the projects to contain your user lib. 
You should be good to go (if any issues please reach me at: bss.stoyanov@gmail.com)  

Approach: Using BDD and Page Objects a home_page.feature document 
which contains all the tests in readable and the same time executable sintax

It contains 2 scenarios:
1. User selects 3 sites and then verifies that the prices have changed on all 3 separete plans 
2. User selects to buy Sucuri Antivirus and then signs up.
